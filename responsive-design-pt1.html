                <h1>Responsive design 
                </br>part I</h1>
                <p>Read my top take-aways from the Scrimba responsive design module. Here's the first part of my checklist
                for creating a website that is fully responsive.</p>
            </div>

        </section>

        <section class="blog-section container">

            <p>The responsive design module on Scrimba has cleared up so many CSS questions for me. As I worked through 
            it I made some notes that I have turned into this checklist, that is as much for me as it is for anyone else! 
            There's definitely still a lot of CSS that seems like sorcery, but I'm now feeling a little more confident
            that I can build something that is actually responsive.  I hope you find this useful too.....</p>
            
            <h2>1. Mobile first design</h2>
            <p>It turns out it is SO MUCH easier to start off by designing something to fit a small screen and then scaling 
            it up with media queries than to start big and then try to scale it down.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Use the viewport meta tag</h2>
            <p>Include the following meta tag in the head of your html to ensure your site is optimised 
            for all screen sizes:</p>
            <img src="img/viewport-img.png" alt="viewport meta tag code snippet" class="blog-seciton__img">
            
            <h2>3. Use a container class to centre your contents</h2>
            <p>Block elements will automatically take up 100% of the parent element's width, so if you set the 
            contents of your page within elements with the class "container" and set that container's width
            to say, 90%, and centre the container, it ensure's your contents looks tidy and remains at the centre of 
            the vieport. You could even set a max-width to stop the contents spreading out on a wider screen.</p>
            <img src="img/container-img.png" alt="container class code snippet" class="blog-seciton__img">
            
            <h2>4. Inline and block elements</h2>
            <p>OK, so this one isn't strictly about responsive design, but it is one of those CSS layout quirks that I will
            need to keep coming back to: block elements will automatically display one on top of the other and inline elements 
            will display in a row.  To change this behaviour use</br>
            <strong>display: inline-block;</strong> to make block elements appear in a row</br>
            <strong>display: block;</strong> to make inline elements display one on top of another</br>
            As images are inline elements a handy hint was to set up the CSS for all images like so:</p>
            <img src="img/img-element-img.png" alt="img element code snippet" class="blog-seciton__img">
            <p><a href"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/inline-elements-and-block-elements-in-html-explained/#:~:text=Inline%20Element%3A&text=Inline%20elements%20occupy%20the%20space,%3E%20%2C%20etc">
            This Free Code Camp article </a>explains in more detail</p>

            <h2>5. Setting image and container size</h2>
            <p>Use % to set the size of images and containers. This ensures that they flex along with the screen size. But use 
            pixels to set max width so that your contents doesn't get too spread out on a large screen.</p>

            <h2>6. Font sizing</h2>
            <p>REM is the unit that should be used for font size. REM means "root element font size". Rather than fixing font 
            sizes in pixels if you set them to be relative to the root font size then to make your page responsive you simply 
            increase the root element size with your media queries as the screen size increases.  In the below example even if the font size of the 
            root element changes the font size of the H1 will always be 2 x the root element's font size.</p>
            <img src="img/REM-img.png" alt="REM code snippet" class="blog-seciton__img">
            <p>REM is also a winner when it comes to accessibility as users are able to change their browser's root font size.
            In this case your text would scale accordingly.</p>

            <h2>7. Margin and padding sizing</h2>
            <p>EM is the unit to use when sizing margin and padding. Like REM, EM is scalable, but instead of being relative 
            to the root element EM is relative to the parent element's font size, which of course is relative to the root 
            element if you have used REM to size your font.</p>

            </br><p>That's all for Part I. In <a href="responsive-design-pt2.html">Part II </a>I'll go into media queries and using grid layout to make your design responsive.</p>
