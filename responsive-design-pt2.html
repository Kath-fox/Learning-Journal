                <h1>Responsive design 
                </br>part II</h1>
                <p>Read my top take-aways from the Scrimba responsive design module. Here's the second part of my checklist
                for creating a website that is fully responsive.</p>
            </div>

        </section>

        <section class="blog-section container">

            <p>The responsive design module on Scrimba has cleared up so many CSS questions for me. As I worked through 
            it I made some notes that I have turned into this checklist, that is as much for me as it is for anyone else! 
            There's definitely still a lot of CSS that seems like sorcery, but I'm now feeling a little more confident
            that I can build something that is actually responsive.  I hope you find this useful too.....</p>
            
            <h2>8.Line height</h2>
            <p>Set the line height to a unitless number value that relates to the font size of the element. As a rule of 
            thumb set it to 1.5 (1.5 x the font size)</p>
            
            <h2>9. Media queries</h2>
            <p>Use media queries to adjust font size and layout on larger screens. Larger screens will likely need more 
            white space from padding and margins and navigations should also be different depending on screen size.  Use 
            flex to display a nav in one row for a larger screen and block to display in a column for a small screen. 
            Common media query break points are as follows, but you should use this as a guide and go with what works for 
            your specific project:<br>
            <strong>480px</br>
            768px</br>
            1024px</br>
            1280px</strong></p>
        
            <h2>10. Background images</h2>
            <p>When setting a background image set the size to "cover" so that it adjusts to the size of the screen whilst 
            maintaining its ratio.</p>
            
            <h2>11. Use grid template areas to achive a responsive layout</h2>
            <p>Using grid template areas can really help you to visualise your layout. One you have defined your grid areas 
            media queries become much easier to manage. In the below example you can see how easy it is to switch up your 
            layout as the screen size increases:</p></br>

            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_grids" target="_blank">This 
            MDN article </a>gives some really clear examples</p>


            <h2>12. Use minmax to make column sizes more responsive</h2>
            <p>As opposed to using pixels to fix the size of grid columns you can use minmax to allow them to flex depending
            on the size of the viewport. Even better, set the min in pixels and use the 'fr' unit for the max.  The fr unit is 
            fractional and will allocate the element space depending on what is available, so when the screen size is small this 
            will ensure elements stay above the minimum size, but when there is plenty of space the size will be dictated by what 
            is available.
            </p>

            <h2>13. The ultimate responsive grid layout - no media queries required</h2>
            <p>Kevin Powell shared this great tip for achieving a responsove image gallery or similar using the method described 
            above and adding in the auto-fit keyword, which allows your columns to wrap into a new row if there is not enough space 
            to accomodate the min width, which means that without needing any media queries your grid will resize itself!</p>

            <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/" target="_blank">This css-tricks.com article
            </a>gives a couple of great examples of making a responsive grid without media queries.</p>

            </br><p>And that's a wrap ðŸ˜Š I hope there were a few useful nuggets in there. With many thanks to Guil Hernandez and Kevin 
            Powell for for sharing their expertise through the Scrimba responsive design module. Now onwards and upwards to APIs!</p>
